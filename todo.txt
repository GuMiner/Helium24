In rough priority order:
- Attributions page.
- Create a new favicon and logo.
- Process all the 'unprocessed' pages.
- Update the projects page to load dynamically and support sorting, searching, etc, by storing the project metadata server-side, not duplicated in places.
- Add current projects (milling, numanistics, spinner, hiking, skiing, etc)
- Update all project thumbnails to be auto-generated or at least better.
- Finish the QC page
- Update the Documentation page to be a project and load much, much faster with better SQL queries.

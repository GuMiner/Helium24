Other:
- Speed up POI queries on the mapping page, clear errors and indicate when they repeat.
- Add location-based POI loading for the map page, along with the ability to clear POI types you don't want to see.
- Setup auto-CI environment instead of manually deploying.

Projects Page:
- Fix project pages to auto-wrap if multiple images are in a row.
- Update the projects page to load dynamically and support sorting, searching, etc

Missing Projects:
- Add current projects (milling, numanistics, spinner, hiking, skiing, both other PCB boards, etc)
- Update all project thumbnails to be auto-generated or at least better.
- Finish the QC page
- Add the Documentation page as a project with faster / better SQL queries.

Ideas:
- Fractal CSG?
- Demo of different web technologies?
- Animated icons for actions?
- Website realtime perf analysis (like speedtest, but more comprehensive)?
- Replica of a tank wireframe game -- in js?
- Add publically-facing weather, news, stocks, space satellite, and astronomy data pages?

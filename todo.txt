In rough priority order:
- Setup auto-CI environment instead of manually deploying.
- Create MD JS converter for github projects.
- Fix project pages to auto-wrap if multiple images are in a row.
- Update the projects page to load dynamically and support sorting, searching, etc
- Add current projects (milling, numanistics, spinner, hiking, skiing, both other PCB boards, etc)
- Update all project thumbnails to be auto-generated or at least better.
- Finish the QC page
- Update the Documentation page to be a project and load much, much faster with better SQL queries.

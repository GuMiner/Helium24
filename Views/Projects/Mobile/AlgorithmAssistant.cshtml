        The main focus of the demo program was on searching and sorting algorithms, with a few miscellaneous physics and math-based algorithms added
        for additional visualization.

        This phone application is structured so that once a visualization type is defined, it's very easy to create new algorithms that use the visualization
        type. For example, most of the <b>Sorting</b> visualizations feature a bar-graph sort view. I also tried to polish this to be an 'official' phone application,
        so this application includes support for landscape orientation, includes transition animations, and is partly-localized to additional languages.

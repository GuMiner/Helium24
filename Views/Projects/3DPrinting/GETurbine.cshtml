            Available from <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:392115">Thingiverse</a>, this print was a mechanical parts test.
            While this model required a significant amount of time (and sanding), the turbine is able to freely spin on the two
            bearings attached to the frame.
            <br />
            Print time was excessive.

            With the printing tolerances in my inexpensive 3D printer, each gear needed sanding for proper alignment.
            However, each gear nicely aligns with each other once sanding was complete.

            The slicer software would generate extreme vibration about halfway through the print, as it attempted to trace out thin vanes of the main fan.
            <br />
            The solution was to send the model into <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/3d-builder/9wzdncrfj3t6">3D Builder</a> and reduce the model quality until there were few enough triangles to avoid the vibration.

        Available from <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:14519">Thingiverse</a>, this print was a size and thin-walled part test.
        <br />
        Print time was 180 minutes.

        This print was performed with 5% infill, and with a very thin wall, leaving an extremely hollow interior.
        <br />
        Unfortunately, this infill was too little, leading to one of the legs to partially break, revealing the innards.

            Designed to hold Samsung Galaxy Centura phones perpendicular to the table, these holders
            are both artistic and functional
            <br /> 
            Key components -- the USB connector and camera -- are unimpeded by the design of the holder.
            <br />
            <br />
            Print time is 90 minutes.

            Key features:
            <ul>
                <li>The arcs at the top are shallow enough to print without overhang and trace around the micro USB power input.</li>
                <li>The cross-bars in the middle hold the halfs together, while also resting the phone at the same height as the base layer.</li>
                <li>All arcs are filled-in on the outside, to more easily print the holder.</li>
            </ul>

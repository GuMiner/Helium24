            This chess board was created within 10 minutes using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Visio">Visio</a>,
            and engraved in 30 minutes on the Universal laser.

            Normally the translucent (engraved) squares would be completely opaque, but by (accidentally) reducing the 
            laser power I instead engraved marbled squares.

        @Html.Partial("Common/ParagraphStart.cshtml")
            With 3"-scale chess pieces from the <a href="http://www.unclesgames.com/">local game store</a>, the chess set was made complete.

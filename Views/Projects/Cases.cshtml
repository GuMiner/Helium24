        After having my 3D printer for about two years, most of my useful projects have involved using the printer to create unusually-shaped cases.

            <h4>Fall 2015</h4>
            After getting an Arduino Nano for my <a href="/Projects/CncMillSoftware">CNC Mill Software</a> project, I 3D printed a slide-on case for it.
            This case covers all the pins (except for the ones I use to communicate with the mill), keeps the programming pins available, and has a cutout for
            the status LEDs. As a bonus, once it is slid in, the micro USB connection helps keep the case in place.

            <h4>Fall 2014</h4>
             A Raspberry case (Model A) was one of my first print attempts with my printer, but I accidentally static-fried the Pi when putting it in the case. 
             I intend this to be my media-center device, but haven't found much high-quality media to use with it so far.

    <h3>Intel Galileo Gen 2 Base and Case</h3>

        <aside>
            <h4>Fall 2014</h4>
             The Galileo board has been much more useful than my Raspberry Pi, and currently serves as a remote webcam viewer, FTP file server, Apache PHP server, and Postgres SQL DB.
            <br />
            <br />
            In terms of the cases itself, the base design (intersecting waves) was very complicated to export due to the large number of intersecting cutout cylinders. The top 
            design, although easier to model, was difficult because the red and green plastics melted at different temperatures -- the green plastic has started to delaminate, while 
            the red top has always looked a bit melted.

            <h4>Spring 2014</h4>
             I had bought a lithium-polymer USB battery charger and a USB-ASP Atmel programmer, both without cases. These were both <i>very</i> tight fits -- these were my first 3D prints
             after the Geiger counter project, and I should have recalibrated the printer in the intervening months.

    <h3>Geiger Counter Case</h3>
    <div class="content-wrapper">
        <article>

            <h4>Fall 2013</h4>
            You can download the design from <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:191113">Thingiverse</a>, purchase
            the electronics from <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/diygeigercounter/home">DIY Geiger</a>, the
            geiger counter tube from <a href="http://www.goldmine-elec-products.com/">Electronic Goldmine</a>, and a test
            uranium-glazed pottery test source from Ebay.
            <br />
            <br />
            <i>This was the last large project I was able to complete before my Senior Design Course. The entire construction
                process can be seen in one of my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/96321741@N08/sets/72157638087784656/">Flickr albums</a>.

            This case stores 6-AA's, the main electronics, the geiger-counter tube (snap-on), and various interactive components, such
            as the power switch (left side) and brightness control (right side). If I had a bigger 3D printer, I'd have stored the tube
            above the LCD or to the side, but this design as-is nearly covers the entire build plate of my Printrbot.

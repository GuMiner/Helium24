## About
### DataProcessing
This folder contains scripting to generate puzzle databases. These puzzle databases simplify solving word puzzles. 

For example, "find a word that starts with 'e', ends with 'g', and is 7 characters long" is a supported query on the [Puzzle Tooling](https://helium24.net/PuzzleTooling) page of Helium24.net.


### Helium
This folder contains the backing code behind Helium24.net.

Helium24.net is my personal website for demos, prototypes, and experiments. As such, it'll usually be in some state of development at all times.
